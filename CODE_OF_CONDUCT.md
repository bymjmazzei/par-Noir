## üõ°Ô∏è **Enforcement Responsibilities**

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## üìè **Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

- Using an official e-mail address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Speaking at conferences or meetups
- Participating in interviews or media coverage

## üîç **Enforcement**

### **Instances of Abusive, Harassing, or Otherwise Unacceptable Behavior**

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **Email**: conduct@parnoir.com
- **GitHub Issues**: Use the "Code of Conduct Violation" template
- **Direct Message**: Contact project maintainers directly

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### **Enforcement Guidelines**

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### **1. Correction**
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### **2. Warning**
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### **3. Temporary Ban**
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### **4. Permanent Ban**
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## ü§ù **Reporting Guidelines**

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to the community leaders by emailing conduct@parnoir.com.

### **What to Include in Your Report**

- **Your contact information** (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
- **Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms)** of any individuals involved
- **Description of what happened** and, if possible, a link to the relevant content
- **Description of why you believe this incident violates the Code of Conduct**
- **Any additional context** that you believe would be helpful

### **What Happens After You File a Report**

You will receive an email from the community leaders acknowledging receipt within 24 hours (and will aim to respond much sooner than that).

The community leaders will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:
- What happened
- Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
- What kind of response is appropriate

If the person who filed the report is concerned about retaliation or would prefer to remain anonymous, the community leaders will respect that request and not share their name with the person whose behavior is being reported.

### **Appeals**

Only permanent resolutions (such as permanent bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision, contact the community leaders at conduct@parnoir.com with your appeal and the community leaders will review the case.
